# lstm-fcn

### General presentation:
LSTM-FCN for Long Short Term Memory Fully Convolutional Network is an enhancement of FCN, which was considered as the reference algorithm for time series classification. The LSTM-FCN algorithm achieves better results, compared to other algorithms, for different types of time data such as: weather reports, financial information, psychological signals, or electrocardiograms. For more details about the algorithm: [LSTM-FCN](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8141873)

### Data set:
We will work on the application of the algorithm to a database containing electrocardiograms of 2 different types, which will allow us to assess the appropriateness of using this new algorithm in a specific case.

### Results (Acuracy):
- k-NN: 93,06% for k = 1 
- LSTM-FCN: 100,00% !
